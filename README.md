# Neural substrates for moral judgments of psychological versus physical harm

This repository includes data and code for behavioral and ROI-based analyses from the project PSYCH-PHYS.

Analyses were performed in R, and the code is provided in R Markdown format.

If you want to look at the outputs (as well as code), I recommend looking at PSYCH-PHYS_analyses.nb.html (you might have to download the entire .zip file and extract the files from it in order to view the .html file properly).

If you have any questions and/or comments, feel free to contact me.
